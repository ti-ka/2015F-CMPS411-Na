                <br />Hello, my name is Alyssa Carson and at the age of 3 I wanted to fulfill my dream of being an astronaut. I hope to be the first or one of the first on Mars. I would love to go to Mars because it is a planet that no one has been before.

                <br /><br />It’s about the same size as the Earth and there are ice caps at the top and bottom of Mars. That means there is water on Mars. This could possibly be our next Earth. Just think about all the things that are in Space. For example: planets we have never explored, galaxies that we have never heard of, stars that are just babies, black holes that are as wide as the Sun to Pluto multiple times and has the mass of a billion suns, parts of the universe that we have never seen.

                <br /><br />Just think of all that stuff just floating around. It’s more than you can imagine.
